 Additional WI logic:
Initialize variable Del_change = YES 
On first instance, on click Add more- Make the variable to Del_change NO; Disable Deliverable Box; With increment logic - save the story name in "Story_id".
When variable NO = Add only Tasks; Add "#StoryID in Parent"
When YES = Story + Task , Tasks ; Enable Deliverable box
del_change  work is this is a command button7 logic is after 1 st intance of user  may click this Del_change button click we gave user to prompt are you change the deliverable :
if YES 
     Del_change = YES
     clearallinputs 
Enable textbox 8

If No Means 
   disable that textbox 8 and text is visible
   clearall inputs expcept textbox8. 
 Del_change = NO


Add new Button this is that button 7 - "New deliverable" - On click : Yes/No.
Yes: Clear all text boxes, "Deliverable_change = YES"; Repeat point 4, 2.
On point 2; Update Story ID and repeat the process
After 1st instance of user input Set flag for  
column B start paste in getting values from B48:B49 we get that and paste 1st instance os user input. set flag to false
variable Del_change = YES 
Copy row in sheet2 A48:K49 and paste it in last empty row in sheet3
text box logic below to manipulate the sheet2 rows we this
TextBox8.value & " (" & TextBox2.value & ")" ' Concatenate and replace in column C
        TextBox3.value ' Replace in column D
        TextBox4.value ' Replace in column K
        TextBox5.value ' Replace in column I
        TextBox23.value ' Replace in column H
         TextBox24.value ' Replace in column J    
after 2 nd instance set flag to true increment by 1 ,  the column B for 2 rows by based on last value in the B column


2 row it has to update A48:K48 and A49:K49
in B column it integers incremented 
create variable and store Story_id = get the 1 row B column value


variable Del_change = NO
Copy row in sheet2 A49:K49 and paste it in last empty row in sheet3
text box logic below to manipulate the sheet2 rows we this
TextBox8.value & " (" & TextBox2.value & ")" ' Concatenate and replace in column C
        TextBox3.value ' Replace in column D
        TextBox4.value ' Replace in column K
        TextBox5.value ' Replace in column I
        TextBox23.value ' Replace in column H
         TextBox24.value ' Replace in column J
after 2 nd instance set flag to true increment by 1, the column B for 1 row by based on last value in the B column


1 row it has to update A49:K49
create variable and store Story_id = get the 1 row update this value to E column like example : "#storyid"
